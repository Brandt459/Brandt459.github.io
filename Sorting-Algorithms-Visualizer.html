								<h2>Overview</h2>
								<p>
									This program shows the processes of heap sort, quick sort, bubble sort, and selection sort.
									The speed at which the screen updates can be changed by dragging the scale to a lower number for faster speed or a higher number for slower speed.
									Before running a sorting algorithm, the bars must be shuffled.
								</p>
								<h2>Problems Faced</h2>
								<p>
									One of the issues I faced when implementing the quick sort algorithm was that sometimes there would be overlapping bars in the same spot.
									The way a swap is programmed to work visually in the program is that bar A would be deleted from the screen, followed by bar B, and then each bar would be redrawn on the screen in the other bar's previous spot.
									If a swap were to occur with just one bar, that bar would be deleted twice and then redrawn twice, causing a duplicate.
									After a close inspection, I realized that sometimes the algorithm would swap a bar with itself, which would cause a duplicate bar.
									I was able to fix this issue by ensuring that before making a swap, the bars were evaluated to not be the same.
								</p>
								<h2>Learning Outcomes</h2>
								<p>
									I enjoyed learning about how the various sorting algorithms work and how to implement them into my own program.
									I also learned about the Python tkinter GUI library and how to update the UI while executing an algorithm at certain intervals.
