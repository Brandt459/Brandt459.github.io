								<h2>Problem</h2>
								<p>
									For my Data Structures and Algorithms II class, I was tasked with developing an algorithm to determine the delivery route of packages.
									There was a CSV file containing data on 40 packages, including the package's destination and delivery deadline, and another CSV file containing a list of 27 locations with the distances between each location.
									Three trucks were allocated for use within the algorithm, with each truck having a capacity of 16 packages.
									The total combined mileage of the routes was not to exceed 140 miles.
								</p>
								<h2>Algorithm</h2>
								<p>
									The algorithm I decided to implement for this project is called a greedy algorithm.
									The algorithm would start by determining if there were packages left to be delivered.
									If there were packages with delivery deadlines remaining, the package with the soonest deadline would be picked.
									Otherwise, the package with the location closest to the current location would be selected.
									This would be repeated 15 times, to ensure that the route's package count does not go over the truck's capacity, or until there are no more packages to be delivered.
								</p>
								<h2>Problems Faced</h2>
								<p>
									When I finished developing the algorithm for the first time, the total combined mileage was 165 miles.
									Since this was over the maximum mileage allowed, I had to determine where my algorithm was lacking in efficiency.
									I realized that some locations had multiple packages to be delivered to them.
									The algorithm was originally prioritizing packages with delivery deadlines by the earliest deadline, disregarding whether there was another package to be delivered to this location.
									After adding a rule to deliver multiple packages with the same destination at the same time, the total combined mileage went from 165 miles to 127 miles.
								</p>
								<h2>Learning Outcomes</h2>
								<p>
									This project improved my attention to detail and ability to persevere through a problem by making me focus on each detail of the algorithm to determine what was causing the inefficent routes.
									Additionally, I learned about the chaining hash table data structure and how to work with CSV files in Python.
